\maketitle

This report present our method and prediction results of for the regression and classification tasks. For the regression task, we have decided to train three different models and a model selector, we obtain respectable performance except for some outliers which have too much impact on our RMSE. We discut about some improvement possible to solve this problem.
For the classification task, we have decided to train two different models this time.
